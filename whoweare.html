    <div class="about-the-cooper-union-title">About The Cooper Union</div>
    <div class="about-the-cooper-union-text">The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art was founded in 1859 by inventor and philanthropist Peter Cooper. The Cooper Union encompasses three schools for art, architecture, and engineering, with each school focusing heavily on detailed project and portfolio work, and each school maintaining low acceptance rates for admissions. Through its history, The Cooper Union has seen speeches delivered by civil rights activists, historians, writers, Presidents, and has proudly service as a beacon in the community. Presently, the Cooper Union maintained a strong community between students, professors, and alumni, with all three groups coming together for a variety of events both in and outside of the school. The school had been historically free until 2014, when it began charging tuition, but the will and determination of the students has not faltered, and students continue to take in all Cooper has to offer, and fulfill Peter Cooper's wishes.

    <div class="about-the-cooper-union-title">About The Great Hall</div>
    <div class="about-the-cooper-union-text">As one of the most iconic venues in New York City, the Great Hall in Cooper&#8217;s Foundation Building has served as a symbol of the community, and has an extraordinary history. In 1860, Abraham Lincoln proudly delivered his &lsquo;right makes might&rsquo; speech in a school that was founded on the same principles he aimed to deliver. The Great Hall has since seen six other sitting Presidents deliver iconic speeches, and has also hosted a variety of events within the school itself. Students in the school put on the annual Culture Show, freshmen are introduced to Cooper Union within the Great Hall, and it used for seminars on art, architecture, engineering, and more. The history and grandiose of the Great Hall is highly appreciated and recognized, making the Great Hall one of the most interesting and unique places in New York City.

            <div class="bio-text">Anish Malladi is a visionary first, and a realist later. That&#8217;s how he likes to put it, anyway. He majors in mechanical engineering at the Cooper Union, but cares just as much about international relations as he does about cars. As a part of his career in Model UN, he trained many young students in the art of diplomacy. He loves photography and travelling to new and beautiful places &#8208; capturing all the unique moments that he can. He attributes that to his time spent living in London, India and New York. Often, you will find him either curled up with a good book, or playing around with his camera. He has a dream of being someone who is known for making the world a better place, and lining up with that, his biggest hope for TEDxCooperUnion is to make a difference in the way people think about unity, making them hope for a better world that they can help create.</div>
