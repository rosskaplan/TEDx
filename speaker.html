            <div class="bio-name">David Gersten</div>
            <div class="bio-text">David Gersten is an influential and motivational thinker based in New York City. As the previous Dean of Architecture at The Cooper Union School Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture, his drawings, stories and constructions have appeared in numerous international exhibitions, and are held in the collection of the Canadian Center for Architecture, the New York City Public Library's print collection and many private collections. He has published extensively on diverse areas of research including: The financial markets, ethics and technology, the poetic / material imagination, social justice and the linkages between perception, language and space. Gersten believes strongly that we can learn from our differences, and to learn from underdeveloped places, where resources and education are not widely available.  Knowledge takes many forms, and those who have different hardships have valuable knowledge to teach us; we just have to find a way to give them voices.</div>

            <div class="bio-name">Oscar Rene Cornejo</div>
            <div class="bio-text">Oscar Rene Cornejo's work is comprised of constructed abstractions imbued with cultural and historical cues, referencing social critical theory, contemporary issues around violence, and the dichotomies of the immigrant experience. The sculptural paintings oscillate between poetics and politic, acting as reflections on the social and cultural dissonance caused by the Salvadoran civil war, historical memory, and the role of U.S. foreign policy within Latin America.  Cornejo is concerned with displacement and resilience, and through his constructed combines and modular prints, he reconciles fragmented histories to activate and reveal hidden narratives carried within the Central American diaspora. </div>
